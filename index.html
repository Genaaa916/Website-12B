        <div class="col-lg m-3 bg-light border rounded"><h3 class="mb-3">What is 3D rendering?</h3>
        <p>3D rendering is a process of turning information from a 3D model into a 2D image. <br> Often the image is produced in the hopes of making it look realistic, therefore simulating a real photographic image. </p></div>
        <div class="col-lg bg-light border rounded m-3"><h3 class="mb-3">How is 3D rendering useful in architectural design?</h3>
        <p>3D rendering is a valuable tool often used in architecture. It plays a key role in both exterior and interior design, letting the designer see a finished design before having to physically execute a design. <br> This way, the designer can play with different options, such as sizes, color patterns and designs before implementing them. </p></div>
        <div class="col-lg bg-light border rounded m-3"><h3 class="mb-3">How else is 3D rendering used?</h3>
        <p>3D rendering is also an effective marketing tool. <br> Imagine you're building a housing complex, and you want to put condos up for sale. Traditionally, you can only sell tangible things - things that the end user can see and/or touch. <br> Therefore, selling a condo that isn't yet built would be impossible. However, with 3D rendering, the sales process can begin before the complex is even built. <br> Photorealistic renderings of a flat are a great tool for pre-marketing of said flat, and give customers an accurate idea of what the end product will look like. </p></div>
